      <h2>About <span class="underline1">Me</span></h2>
      <p>This is Bhanu Prakash,an embedded enthisiast and an interactive designer.I really like to look professioanl but also have personal flare. I'm obsessed with making things and even more obsessed with making thing better. I've been interested in embedded
        from my childhood. I was a kind of child who screws off his toys and check beneath it as what is inside. This question What is inside ? makes me an enthusiast of learning new technologies. while grauduation I am much interested to look forward
        in embedded platform, where i can unveil my problem solving skills to meet the challenges of developing world. Apart from technical aspects, I also have sufficient management skills which makes me to organise and manage situations under pressure
        as it makes me a teamlead.</p>

        <h2>Biometric voting machine</h2>
        <p>This project is all about a voting machine,where it reduces man power, time effeicient. This machine overcomes the problem of rigging because voting is done by the process of biometric process using arduino,fingerprint sensor and IDE compiler
          which makes the exact voter to vote only once.</p>
